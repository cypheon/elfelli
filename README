 ELFELLI README
----------------

This is Elfelli, a tool to calculate and visualize electric flux lines
around charged bodies.
To run Elfelli, gtkmm, at least version 2.8, needs to be installed. 


-----------
 COMPILING
-----------

To compile Elfelli, you need SCons. In many distributions you will also
need the development package of gtkmm (in Debian this is 'libgtkmm-2.4-dev').
Compiling itself is very simple:

$ scons


--------------
 INSTALLATION
--------------

To install Elfelli, simply type:

$ scons install

By default, it is installed in '/usr/local'. If you want to change that
prefix, alter the install command to:

$ scons install prefix=/install/prefix
